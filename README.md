Final projecty for me Sdev web app class

This was a group project completed as the final grade for my web app class.

## Project Requirements:

### Stage 1: 
Create a list of courses, and teachers that can be created, viewed, edited, and deleted. Teachers will have the ability to add and delete these courses at will. At first any teacher can delete any other teachersâ€™ courses, but we will update it so that courses only created by the currently signed-in teacher can be deleted. There should be a couple of pages viewable during this stage of development

At the end of Stage 1 the following should be completed:

-   A place to add courses (or an index of courses with a button to add new courses
-   An index/ webpage of all courses that have been created.
-   The website links active, and partially designed
-   The ability to view an individual course

### Stage 2:
Students should be able to navigate classes either based on the course name or number. Students should have the ability to sign in, sign out, and possibly register users. The students should be able to add the classes to their own schedule so that they know which classes they are taking. They should also be able to view a screen with all of the classes they are currently signed up for. The students should also be able to delete or drop a class. 

At the end of Stage 2 the following should be completed:

-   A login system should be implemented
-   Authorization should be differentiated between student and teachers
-   Students should be able to add courses to their schedule
-   Students should be able to drop courses from their schedule
